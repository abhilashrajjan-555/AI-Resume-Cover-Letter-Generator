## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please avoid opening a public issue.

Instead, report it privately with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Potential impact
- Suggested remediation (if known)

I will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and work on a fix before public disclosure.
